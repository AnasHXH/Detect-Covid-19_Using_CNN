This COVID-19 dataset consists of Non-COVID and COVID cases of both X-ray and CT images. The associated dataset is augmented with different augmentation techniques to generate about 17100 X-ray and CT images. The dataset contains two main folders, one for the X-ray images, which includes two separate sub-folders of 5500 Non-COVID images and 4045 COVID images. The other folder contains the CT images. It includes two separate sub-folders of 2628 Non-COVID images and 5427 COVID images

### I collects Data from to link and sperated it to 3 main folder :
### First one for COVID
### Second one for NORMAL
### Third one for PNEUMONIA
